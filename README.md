## Key Insights

- **Technology Sector**: Lowest climate risk (avg 10.8/100)
- **Consumer Sectors**: Highest risk exposure (43-46/100) 
- **Market Cap Correlation**: Larger companies show greater resilience
- **ESG Integration**: Strong negative correlation with climate risk

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Streamlit**: Dashboard framework
- **yFinance**: Real-time financial data
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

## Methodology

### Risk Scoring Framework
Our proprietary climate risk model evaluates companies across multiple dimensions:

1. **Physical Risk (35%)** - Geographic climate exposure
2. **Transition Risk (45%)** - Policy and market transition exposure  
3. **Financial Resilience (20%)** - Adaptive capacity and governance

### Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance API** - Real-time financial metrics
- **ESG Databases** - Environmental, social, governance scores
- **Sector Analysis** - Industry-specific risk profiles
- **Time Series Data** - 24-month risk trend analysis
